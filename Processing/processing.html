                            <p>Processing is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of visual arts. It's a platform that allows artists, designers, and beginners to create interactive visuals, animations,
                                and simulations. With its simple and intuitive interface, Processing enables users to quickly prototype ideas and explore creative coding without getting bogged down in complex syntax. The Processing environment consists
                                of a programming language (based on Java) and an integrated development environment (IDE). It's known for its accessibility, making it a popular choice for artists and designers who want to incorporate code into their creative
                                work.

                                <p>The following code is a simple example of Java processing game that captures keyboard and mouse input. Let's try to understand each line of code.</p>
                                <li>int x, y; //Declare two integer variables to store the shape's x and y coordinates.</li>
                                <li>color rectColor; declares a variable to store the shape's color. void setup(){- Begins a function called one only at the start of program.</li>
                                <li>Size (600, 400).-The canvas can be 600 x 400 pixels. You can give it as like your needs.</li>
                                <li>x = width/2; - The X coordinate of the shape's initial position is set in half way across the canvas.<br>y = height/2; – The Y coordinate of the shape is set to half way up in the center.</li>

                                <li>rectocolor = color(255); //Sets the shape's color to white. void draw() -- Begins a drawing function that is called over and over to refresh the screen.</li>
                                <li>background 200; - Light gray background.</li>
                                <li>fill(rectColor) – Sets the fill color to the value stored in rectColor. rect (x, y, 50, 50) - Draws a box of length and width equal to 50 pixels at position (x.y).</li>
                                <li>void keyPressed() { void Starting the function that runs if a keystroke is typed.</li>
                                <li>if (keyCode == UP) { y -= 10; }; - Pressing the up arrow key lowers Y by 10.</li>
                                <li>else if (keyCode == DOWN) { y += 10; }Pressing the down arrow key gives an increment of 10 to Y.</li>
                                <li>else if (keyCode == LEFT) { x -= 10; } - If keyCode is the left arrow, decrement its value from that of x by 10.</li>
                                <li>else if (keyCode == RIGHT){ x += 10; }; Pressing the right arrow key increases the x coordinate by 10.</li>
                                <li>void mousePressed() { - Keyword - This function is called when the left button on the mouse has been pressed.</li>
                                <li>rectColor = color(random(255), random(255), random(255));</li>
                                <p>So basically this code makes a simple game where you can control a box moving using keyboard Arrow and when you will click on this rectangle using your mouse it will change color.</p>

                            <p>Introduction:<br> The project wants to make a picture user interface (GUI) for showing heat and wetness using an Arduino with DHT sensor in Processing. The screen will show live information from the devices. To do this, you'll
                                need an Arduino board, a DHT sensor and Processing software. The Arduino will link to the DHT sensor, and then send data to Processing. There a GUI is made for it. The Processing drawing will be changed to write down the
                                name of your serial port and its speed. This is based on how you have set it up. When you put the code on an Arduino and connect it to your computer, a Processing drawing can be used. It helps show how hot or humid things
                                are in real time using pictures as well. You can use the "meter" library in Processing to make a graphical interface. The project needs parts of the computer and rules that tell it what to do. The resources given show how
                                to put together the hardware part and write code for it.</p>

                            To set up the hardware, you will need an Arduino board and a DHT sensor like DHT11 or DHT22. Also use things called breadboard and jumper wires for it. The sensor is linked to the Arduino as shown in the diagram found online. After setting up the hardware,
                            you need to write code on an Arduino so it can read data from a sensor. Then make a graphic User Interface in Processing that shows temperature and humidity values coming into your computer through the wires of our little helper
                            device called Arduino's serial port. In Processing, you have to add the "meter" library. This is simple: just go into the library manager and look for "meter", then install it. The code for the Arduino and Processing sketch
                            that shows temperature and humidity is in resources. It's made to show those values right away. This project doesn't need lots of knowledge about writing code, and the resources given walk you through step by-step on how to
                            make a user interface with things like Arduino and Processing for seeing temperature changes.

                            <p>This code is written for DHT11 You can also try DHT22 , it might work for both sensor. You can see the code and you will understand , cause i’m given comment beside of my codes. But remember that to change th e port name according
                                to your Arduino port. You can check it from your Arduino IDE in tools section . Or you can follow the below picture.</p>

                            <p>We finished all the code we need. Now, we can setup hardware and run the code. I already mentioned all the required hardware above but for your help i will give the real field picture below:</p>
                            <img src="img/8.jpg" <figure>
                            <p>Here is the basic hardware we need. [DHT11,Breadboard,3 wires, Arduino Uno]. In your case you can replace hardware like DHT22 and Arduino Nano. No let’s connect the wires according to the picture.</p>

                                <li> 1st wire should be Vcc[5v/3.3v]</li>
                                <li> 2nd wire connect with Pin 2 [Arduino Uno] / D2 [Arduino Nano</li>

                                <li>Last pic will connect in GND</li>
                            </ul>

                            <img src="img/c9.gif" <figure>
                            <p>All the setup is done , Now time to connect your Arduino device with your laptop or Desktop whatever you use. And you can follow the video below for real time practical demonstration.</p>
                            </figure>
                            <p>I'm going to tell you how the circuit schematic works, which connects everything. I will explain it in a minute. I have used a USB cable to connect my Arduino board with my laptop. I started the Processing software when I connected
                                Arduino to my laptop. I just needed to press the play button for the code to start working. Right now, the heat measurement, Humidity level readings are shown on dials.

                                <br> I then heated the DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor by myself using a glass of Hot water as you see in the video. The DHT11 is a very slow sensor; it needs time to update the values. The needle on the meter started
                                to shift after I kept using heat on the sensor for almost ten seconds. I was really happy in that moment. Then, since I was using a 2000 millisecond break in the Arduino code.</p>
