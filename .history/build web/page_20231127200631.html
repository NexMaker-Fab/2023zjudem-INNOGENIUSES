    <h3>STEP 5: Make folder and file for writing code to build a website</h3>
    <p>Open VS Code and open clone repository folder. Create a html file, a css file & a JS file. Create a folder for image resources. After that go to the html file which is named index.html and write some basic html documents. You can see all the step
        in snapshot below:
    </p>
    <img src="img/bw1.png" alt="description photo" style="width:100%; height: fit-content;">
    <p>
        Here, I've included links to my external CSS file, a few fonts link, and bootstrap. That will assist me in designing and improving the appearance of my webpage.
    </p>

    <h3>STEP 6: Store Resources in img folder</h3>
    <p>To build a website we need some basic resources, such as logo, favicon, bg-picture, banner, etc. I have to gather all the resources in that folder as You can see all the step in snapshot below:
    </p>
    <img src="img/bw2.png" alt="description photo" style="width:50%; height: 100%;">

    <h3>STEP 7: Title and Title logo</h3>
    <p>An HTML document consists of two primary sections. Head and Body. The title of my website, some meta data, and the title logo—also referred to as a favicon by programmers—can all be written in the Head section. I demonstrate how to write a title and
        put a title logo underneath this image.
    </p>
    <img src="img/bw3.png" alt="description photo" style="width:100%; height: fit-content;">
    <p>
        favicon is a format that can help us put logo in title bar as you can see in the photo. Below of this page you can get how to make a <a href="#logoCreate">Logo</a> free.
    </p>
    <img src="img/title logo.png" alt="description photo" style="width:100%; height: 100%;">
    <h3>STEP 8: Divided and write document for webpage</h3>
    <p>In a Body of the HTML document consists of three primary sections. Header-Main-Footer. I wrote 3 tag and make workspaces for build my webpage step by step. I demonstrate about this tag underneath this image.
    </p>
    <img src="img/bw4.png" alt="description photo" style="width:50%; height:fit-content;">
    <h3>STEP 9: <a href="#BuildLogo">Logo</a> Design</h3>
    <p>A logo might represent a company, a group, or anything else. Therefore, the logo is given top priority on any website. Therefore, we construct a navbar in the Heading section and write some code for that when we add a logo to a website. The code and
        explanation are available in the picture below.
    </p>
    <img src="img/bw5.png" alt="description photo" style="width:100%; height:fit-content;">
    <p>I wrote several lines of code for the button, link, navbar, and logo in the header section. All of the HTML code is shown in the Code Area below.</p>
    <div class="code-boxes">
        <div class="code-box codeBox">
            <div class="topic">Code:</div>
            <textarea id="codeBox" readonly>
                    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Inventore ipsum animi corporis quod delectus pariatur aliquid aut dolor totam corrupti earum veniam rerum laboriosam fuga repellendus maiores error, nostrum atque! 
            </textarea>
            <button id="codeButton">Copy Codes</button>
        </div>
    </div>
    <h3>STEP 10: Switch Day/Night Button</h3>
    <p>These days, day-night mode is a well-known feature of a web.To alter the website's theme and vibe from day to night, I created a switch button within the navigation bar. I've included proof of the code I built to create this day/night switch below.
    </p>
    <div class="code-boxes">
        <div class="code-box codeBox">
            <div class="topic">Code:</div>
            <textarea id="codeBox" readonly>
                Lorem ipsum dolor sit, amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Nulla odio repellat fugiat explicabo velit eveniet distinctio amet natus architecto accusamus.
