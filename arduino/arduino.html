                                <h1>About Arduino</h1>
                                <p>Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and turn it into an output
                                    - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online. You can tell your board what to do by sending a set of instructions to the microcontroller on the board. To do so you use the Arduino programming
                                    language (based on Wiring), and the Arduino Software (IDE), based on Processing. Over the years Arduino has been the brain of thousands of projects, from everyday objects to complex scientific instruments. A worldwide
                                    community of makers - students, hobbyists, artists, programmers, and professionals - has gathered around this open-source platform, their contributions have added up to an incredible amount of accessible knowledge that
                                    can be of great help to novices and experts alike. Arduino was born at the Ivrea Interaction Design Institute as an easy tool for fast prototyping, aimed at students without a background in electronics and programming.
                                    As soon as it reached a wider community, the Arduino board started changing to adapt to new needs and challenges, differentiating its offer from simple 8-bit boards to products for IoT applications, wearable, 3D printing,
                                    and embedded environments.

                                <h3>Why Arduino?</h3>
                                <p>Thanks to its simple and accessible user experience, Arduino has been used in thousands of different projects and applications. The Arduino software is easy-to-use for beginners, yet flexible enough for advanced users.
                                    It runs on Mac, Windows, and Linux. Teachers and students use it to build low cost scientific instruments, to prove chemistry and physics principles, or to get started with programming and robotics. Designers and architects
                                    build interactive prototypes, musicians and artists use it for installations and to experiment with new musical instruments. Makers, of course, use it to build many of the projects exhibited at the Maker Faire, for
                                    example. Arduino is a key tool to learn new things. Anyone - children, hobbyists, artists, programmers - can start tinkering just following the step by step instructions of a kit, or sharing ideas online with other
                                    members of the Arduino community.
                                </p>
                                <p>There are many other microcontrollers and microcontroller platforms available for physical computing. Parallax Basic Stamp, Netmedia's BX-24, Phidgets, MIT's Handyboard, and many others offer similar functionality. All
                                    of these tools take the messy details of microcontroller programming and wrap it up in an easy-to-use package. Arduino also simplifies the process of working with microcontrollers, but it offers some advantage for teachers,
                                    students, and interested amateurs over other systems:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Inexpensive - Arduino boards are relatively inexpensive compared to other microcontroller platforms. The least expensive version of the Arduino module can be assembled by hand, and even the pre-assembled Arduino modules
                                        cost less than \$50</li>
                                    <li>Cross-platform - The Arduino Software (IDE) runs on Windows, Macintosh OSX, and Linux operating systems. Most microcontroller systems are limited to Windows.</li>
                                    <li>Simple, clear programming environment - The Arduino Software (IDE) is easy-to-use for beginners, yet flexible enough for advanced users to take advantage of as well. For teachers, it's conveniently based on the Processing
                                        programming environment, so students learning to program in that environment will be familiar with how the Arduino IDE works.</li>
                                    <li>Open source and extensible software - The Arduino software is published as open source tools, available for extension by experienced programmers. The language can be expanded through C++ libraries, and people wanting
                                        to understand the technical details can make the leap from Arduino to the AVR C programming language on which it's based. Similarly, you can add AVR-C code directly into your Arduino programs if you want to.</li>
                                    <li>Open source and extensible hardware - The plans of the Arduino boards are published under a Creative Commons license, so experienced circuit designers can make their own version of the module, extending it and improving
                                        it. Even relatively inexperienced users can build the breadboard version of the module in order to understand how it works and save money.</li>

                                </ul>

                                <h1>Arduino Output</h1>
                                <p>Arduino outputs refer to signals or actions generated by the Arduino board to interact with the external world. Here are common types of outputs in Arduino:</p>
                                <p>1.Digital Outputs:<br> - Digital Pins:Arduino has digital output pins that can be set to HIGH (outputting voltage) or LOW (no output voltage). These pins are often used to control LEDs, relays, or other digital devices.
                                    <br>- LEDs: Digital output pins are frequently used to drive LEDs, indicating the status of the Arduino or providing feedback in projects.</p>
                                <img src="img/z18.jpg" <figure>
                                </figure>
                                <p>2.Analog Outputs:<br> - PWM (Pulse Width Modulation): Some digital pins on Arduino boards support PWM. PWM is a technique to simulate analog output by rapidly switching a pin between HIGH and LOW. This is often used for
                                    controlling the brightness of LEDs or the speed of motors.
                                    <br>- DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter): In some advanced Arduino boards, there are dedicated pins that provide true analog output voltages. This can be useful for applications that require smooth and continuous voltage
                                    levels.
                                </p>

                                    systems.
                                </p>
                                <p>4.I2C and SPI Communication:<br> - I2C and SPI Outputs: Arduino boards can communicate with other devices using I2C or SPI protocols, serving as both input and output. This is common when interfacing with external sensors,
                                    displays, or other microcontrollers.</p>
                                <p>5. Motor Control:<br> - Motor Outputs: Arduino can control motors using dedicated motor driver shields or modules. By varying the voltage or pulse signals, the Arduino can regulate the speed and direction of motors.</p>
                                <p>6.Sound Output:<br> - Buzzer or Speaker: Arduino can generate tones or play simple melodies through a connected buzzer or speaker. This is often used in projects where audio feedback is required.</p>
                                <p>7.Display Output:<br> - LED Displays, LCDs, and OLEDs: Arduino can control various types of displays to provide visual information. This includes alphanumeric LCDs, graphical OLED displays, and LED matrix displays.</p>
                                <p>Understanding how to use these output options allows Arduino projects to control and influence the external environment. The specific output method chosen depends on the project's requirements and the desired interaction
                                    with the connected devices or systems.</p>

                                    <li>After you choose "Next >", the application will ask you to fill the "project name" and "project location" as show in figure 2. After finish filling the project name and project location, click on "Next >".</li>
                                    <li>Then, the application will ask you to choose the "Project Type"as shown in figure 3. After choosing the "Project Type", click on "Next >".</li>
                                    <li>The next step is to "Add Sources"to your project as show in figure 4. If you already have the file sources, than choose "Add Files". If you don't have any sources, then choose "Create File". You can choose the "HDL
                                        Source For", either "Synthesis & Simulation" or "Simulation Only". On this window, you can also choose the "target language", the options are VHDL and Verilog. Also, you can choose the "simulator language", the
                                        options are VHDL, Verilog, and Mixed. After finish adding sources to your project, click on "Next >".</li>
                                    <li>After that, the application will ask you to "Add Existing IP"as shown in figure 5. This is optional, if you don't want to add IP, just click on "Next >". If you have an existing IP, then choose "Add Files".</li>
                                    <li>Then, the application will ask you to "Add Constraints" as shown in figure 6. This is optional, if you don't want to add constraints, just click on "Next >". If you have a constraints files, then choose "Add Files".</li>
                                    <li>The next step, you will be ask to choose the "Default Part" as shown in figure 7. You can choose to select parts or boards. On the "Light Seeking Mobile Robot" project, the "Family" part chosen was "Artix-7". The "Package"
                                        chosen was "cpg236". The "Speed grade" chosen was "-1". Then, the "Part" used was "xc7a35tcpg236-1". After you finished choosing, click on "Next >".</li>
                                    <li>Finally, the last step is the application will show the "New Project Summary" as shown in figure 8. On this window, the "project type" and the "project name" will be shown if you add one. The "source files or directories"
                                        will be shown if you add one. The "configurable IP" will also be shown if you add one. The "constraints files" will be shown if you add one too. And the last is the "default part" that you have chosen will also
                                        be shown on this window. After that, click "Finish". Once you click "Finish", your new project will be created. And then, you can write you VHDL code there and run "synthesis" after you finish writing your code.
                                        Also you can run a simulation by adding a "simulation sources" that consist of the "test bench" code.</li>

                                    <p>After create a project, the steps to add source in Vivado are as follows :</p>
                                    <li>Click "Add Sources" as indicated by the arrow in figure 1.</li>
                                    <li>The next step select "Add or create design sources" then click "Next>" as shown in figure 2.</li>
                                    <li>The next step fill "File name" box with the name that you want (should descriptive) then click "OK" as shown in figure 3. Don't forget to make sure that you select "VHDL" on "File type box".</li>
                                    <li>After you finish to fill "Entity name" with the name that you want (should descriptive) as shown in figure 4.</li>
                                    <li>Fill the "Port Name" for your source then select "Direction" which either "input" or "output" or "inout" as it should be. Check the "Bus" only if it's more than one bit and fill the "MSB" and "LSB". Just ignore or uncheck
                                        if your port only has one bit. For Example Port A has 4 bit (3 downto 0) so 3 for MSB and 0 for LSB.
                                        <li>MSB : Most Significant Bit</li>
                                        <li>LSB : Least Significant Bit</li>
                                        <li>After you finish input all of your port now you can type VHDL code inside the box as show in figure 5. After finish with your code now you can click the "Run </li>
                                        <li>If there is something wrong with your code, an error warnings will be occurs in box below your code. Don't forget to always learn!</li>

                                    <p>Important note that the USB device that you select to program the Basys 3 must be formatted in Fat32. Other than that your device doesn't have to be empty and can contain other files and folders. At this point Vivado
                                        is no longer needed to program the FPGA, so you can minimize your project and follow these steps in File Explorer:</p>
                                    <li>Make sure the jumper on JP1 is in the USB position. Something looks like first image.</li>
                                    <li>Plug your USB flash device into your computer.</li>
                                    <li>Open File Explorer and navigate to the root folder of your Vivado project.</li>
                                    <li>From root go to root > Project_name.runs > impl_1 and copy the .bit file.</li>
                                    <li>Go to the root of your USB device and paste the .bit file. The Basys3 on startup will only look through the USB's root for a file with a .bit extension so it is important that the only .bit file in root is the one that
                                        you want to be used to program the Basys3.</li>
                                    <li>Safely remove the USB device from your computer and plug it into the USB port on the Basys 3 board. (Second image)</li>
                                    <li>Make sure your board is connected to your computer for power and turn on the Basys 3. It should immediately begin writing the .bit file to the FPGA.</li>
                                    <p>Once finished your board should function exactly as it did when programming it with JTAG. Whether you were aware or not you just successfully programmed your Basys3 board two separate ways using the same .bit file.</p>
